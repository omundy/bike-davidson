### Current Information

- Only one out of [15 nature preserves](https://www.mecknc.gov/ParkandRec/Documents/brochure%20files/prk%20brochure%20nature.pdf) allows any kind of cycling. See also this [list of nature preserves](https://www.mecknc.gov/ParkandRec/StewardshipServices/Pages/Nature-Preserve-Information.aspx)
- Only 3 parks out of [34 community and regional parks](https://www.mecknc.gov/ParkandRec/Documents/brochure%20files/prk%20brochure%20parks.pdf) have mountain bike Trails. That link shows 5 public golf facilities, while the cycling trails total just under 16 miles: [Jetton Park](https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/7015390/jetton-park-mountain-bike-trail) (1 mile), [Colonel Francis Beatty Park](https://www.mtbproject.com/directory/8015505/colonel-francis-beatty-park) (12 miles), and [North Mecklenburg Park](https://www.mtbproject.com/trail/956695/north-mecklenburg) (2.9 miles)
- For another view of the inequity, compare their ["biking" page](https://www.mecknc.gov/ParkandRec/StewardshipServices/Outdoors/Pages/Biking.aspx) (all of these also allow hiking) listing this small quantity with the several massive properties on the hiking page.





### Mecklenburg County Park Explorer

Consider the difference between these two views of the [Mecklenburg County Park Explorer](https://maps.mecklenburgcountync.gov/MecklenburgCountyParkExplorer/) with the mountain filter on and off. Visually, it's significant. But consider also that they list Fisher Farm (managed by Town of Davidson) and the Whitewater Center on the MTB filtered view!
